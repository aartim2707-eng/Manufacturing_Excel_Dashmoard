The Manufacturing Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of production performance, quality, and efficiency. It tracks total production, defects, downtime, and delivery delays while breaking down insights by product, machine, supplier, and shift. Interactive charts highlight defect trends, production efficiency, and monthly output, helping identify bottlenecks and improvement areas. With clear visual storytelling, the dashboard transforms raw data into actionable insights, supporting better decision‑making and operational excellence.
