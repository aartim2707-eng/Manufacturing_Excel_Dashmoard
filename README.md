This project focused on analyzing manufacturing performance through interactive dashboards. Defects were visualized by machine and product to identify improvement areas, while production efficiency was evaluated across shifts and suppliers. Delivery delays and downtime were highlighted to uncover bottlenecks in operations. Beyond the analytics, the project strengthened storytelling skills—transforming dashboards into impactful tools that communicate insights clearly and drive action.
