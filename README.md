# Manufacturing_Excel_Dashmoard
This manufacturing analytics project was designed to uncover operational inefficiencies and highlight opportunities for improvement through data‑driven dashboards. Using Excel as the primary tool, I created a structured visualization framework that transformed raw production data into actionable insights.
✨ Key takeaways from this project:

 📊 Visualized defects by machine & product to spot improvement areas
 ⚡ Analyzed production efficiency across shifts and suppliers
 ⏱️ Highlighted delivery delays & downtime to uncover bottlenecks
 🛠️ Strengthened my storytelling skills—making dashboards not just informative, but impactful.

Feeling proud of this milestone and super motivated to keep pushing my data analytics journey forward! 💡
